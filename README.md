Online FAQ for a medical student association

## Description of the project
This is a personal project I did in my spare time to help a friend who runs a medical student association called ADCN.

The goal of this online FAQ is to allow the members of this association to consult frequently asked questions that they themselves might have.
Moreover, the members of this association reserve the right to add, modify or remove questions from this FAQ.
The site also offers a description of the association and a section where we can contact them.
There is also a registration and login system to add to this online FAQ in the future, a forum where people could ask questions and answer each other

## My vision for this project
I wanted to test a way to develop a website that I had never done before. I used the TWIG framework which is very efficient and optimized for many points.
The questions are stored in a MySQL database
During the development of this site I was able to learn a new technology and it allowed me to improve in some aspects especially concerning the FRONT-END.
The site is available on mobile and computer, so the site is indeed "responsive".
However, I am still looking for a free online host that supports PHP version 8.
